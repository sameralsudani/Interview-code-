# Build a Weather App with Vanilla JavaScript

âœ… [Check out my YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

**Description:**

Learn how to build a Weather App with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and SCSS. This Javascript Project for Beginners uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data and displays a mobile first responsive web design. This Vanilla JS app also features accessibility considerations, the geolocation API, persistent data storage, the Fetch API with Async / Await, and Serverless Functions.

If you have completed my [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk), this is a great project for pulling all of those concepts together in one application.
